# WooCommerce App Frontend Architecture Plan

## Overview
We'll create a modern, visually appealing e-commerce storefront that showcases products in a dynamic and engaging way. The design will follow current e-commerce UX best practices with a focus on discoverability, visual appeal, and smooth navigation.

## UI Components

### 1. Home Screen
- **Hero Banner Carousel**: Rotating promotional banners at the top
- **Featured Categories**: Horizontal scrollable list of main categories with visual icons
- **New Arrivals**: Horizontal product carousel showing newest products
- **Popular Products**: Grid or carousel of best-selling products
- **Special Offers**: Section highlighting discounted or special items
- **Recommended Products**: Personalized product suggestions

### 2. Navigation
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: For main sections (Home, Categories, Search, Cart, Account)
- **App Bar**: With search functionality and cart icon
- **Category Navigation**: Simplified category access through horizontal scrolling lists

### 3. Product Components
- **Product Card**: Clean design with image, title, price, and rating
- **Quick Add to Cart**: One-tap add functionality
- **Wishlist Integration**: Easy save for later

### 4. Visual Design Elements
- **Color Scheme**: Primary, secondary, and accent colors with proper contrast
- **Typography**: Consistent font hierarchy for readability
- **Spacing System**: Consistent padding and margins
- **Animations**: Subtle transitions and micro-interactions
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens instead of spinners

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core UI Components
1. Create reusable widgets for product cards, section headers, and carousels
2. Implement the home screen layout with placeholder data
3. Design and implement the bottom navigation

### Phase 2: Data Integration
1. Connect the UI to the WooCommerce API
2. Implement data fetching for different product sections
3. Add proper loading states and error handling

### Phase 3: Refinement
1. Add animations and transitions
2. Optimize performance
3. Implement pull-to-refresh and pagination
4. Polish visual details and consistency

## Technical Considerations
- Use `Provider` or `Riverpod` for state management
- Implement caching for product images and data
- Optimize list rendering with `ListView.builder`
- Use hero animations for product transitions
- Implement proper error boundaries and fallbacks

## UI Libraries to Consider
- `carousel_slider` for banner and product carousels
- `cached_network_image` for efficient image loading
- `shimmer` for loading effects
- `flutter_staggered_grid_view` for dynamic grid layouts
