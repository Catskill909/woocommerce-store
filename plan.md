## Technical Considerations

### State Management
We'll use Provider for simpler state management needs and Bloc for more complex flows like checkout and authentication.

### API Communication
We'll create a robust API service layer with:
- Interceptors for authentication
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Pagination handling for large data sets

### Data Persistence
We'll implement a multi-layered approach:
- Secure storage for sensitive data (tokens, payment info)
- SQLite for structured data (order history, user preferences)
- Shared preferences for simple settings
- File storage for cached images and offline data

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic and models
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for critical flows (checkout, authentication)
- Performance tests for data-intensive operations
