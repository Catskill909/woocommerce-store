## Summary of Attempts to Resolve `prefer_const_constructors` Warnings

### Context
In the `product_listing_screen.dart` file, we encountered multiple warnings related to the use of `const` constructors. The warnings suggest that we should use the `const` keyword with certain widget constructors to improve performance.

### Warnings Encountered
1. **Warning 1**:
   - **Location**: Line 22
   - **Message**: Use 'const' with the constructor to improve performance.
   
2. **Warning 2**:
   - **Location**: Line 32
   - **Message**: Use 'const' with the constructor to improve performance.
   
3. **Warning 3**:
   - **Location**: Line 33
   - **Message**: Use 'const' with the constructor to improve performance.

### New Warnings Encountered
1. **Warning 4**:
   - **Location**: Line 12
   - **Message**: Use 'const' with the constructor to improve performance.

2. **Warning 5**:
   - **Location**: Line 14
   - **Message**: Use 'const' with the constructor to improve performance.

3. **Warning 6**:
   - **Location**: Line 15
   - **Message**: Use 'const' literals as arguments to constructors of '@immutable' classes.

4. **Warning 7**:
   - **Location**: Line 17
   - **Message**: Use 'const' with the constructor to improve performance.

5. **Warning 8**:
   - **Location**: Line 19
   - **Message**: Use 'const' with the constructor to improve performance.

6. **Warning 9**:
   - **Location**: Line 20
   - **Message**: Use 'const' literals as arguments to constructors of '@immutable' classes.

7. **Warning 10**:
   - **Location**: Line 26
   - **Message**: Use 'const' with the constructor to improve performance.

8. **Warning 11**:
   - **Location**: Line 36
   - **Message**: Use 'const' with the constructor to improve performance.

9. **Warning 12**:
   - **Location**: Line 37
   - **Message**: Use 'const' with the constructor to improve performance.

10. **Warning 13**:
    - **Location**: Line 8 (in `widget_test.dart`)
    - **Message**: Use 'const' with the constructor to improve performance.

### Attempts to Fix
1. **Initial Attempts**:
   - We added the `const` keyword to various widget constructors, including `Card`, `Text`, and `Padding`.
   - Despite adding `const`, the warnings persisted for certain widgets, particularly those that cannot be constant due to their nature (e.g., `Image.network`).

2. **Analysis of Warnings**:
   - The `Image.network` constructor cannot be a `const` constructor because it fetches data from the network, which is inherently dynamic.
   - Other widgets, such as `Padding` and `Text`, can be `const`, but they must be used in a context where their parent widget is also `const`.

3. **Final Observations**:
   - The persistent warnings indicate that while some widgets can be made constant, others cannot due to their inherent properties or the nature of their data.
   - The combination of dynamic and static widgets in the same parent widget can lead to confusion regarding the use of `const`.

### Conclusion
The attempts to resolve the `prefer_const_constructors` warnings have highlighted the limitations of using `const` with certain widget constructors. While we have successfully added `const` to many widgets, the dynamic nature of others prevents us from fully eliminating the warnings. Further refactoring may be needed to isolate dynamic content from static content to fully comply with the `const` requirements.
